# damneasygentoo
An SH script that installs gentoo from a live media, all from a user friendly GUI.
### description
Damn Easy Gentoo is an SH script, that can be invoked with:

        arch-anywhere
       
The script needs internet, so the first step it does is check for a working internet connection ( supports wi-fi, and manually configured lan ). The script doesnt work yet, I'm still developing it eheh. So currently i am in the "set_disks" part and any help would be awesome.

### download
There is no download for the .iso yet. Download the script.
